memoplex is a notifier service.
one-line messages are sent in to stdin:

~ echo hi | memoplex

and messages are read with -r:

~ memoplex -r | something_that_reads_the_messages

which will run forever, outputting messages as they appear.
any number of 'memoplex -r' can be run; messages will be sent
to all of them.  also, when a 'memoplex -r' is initially run,
any old messages from the past five minutes will be flushed.

memoplex is permissioned per-user and only available locally.
but you can use ssh to remotely send and recieve messages
securely, e.g.:
~ ssh myserver 'memoplex -r' | something_that_reads_the_messages

to recap:
- persist all messages for at least some time (five minutes)
- persist messages until some client reads them
- messages can be sent to multiple clients
- any client can submit a message
- postgres-backed
